# Trey Coding: Defensive Coding in JavaScript on Codecademy #

My first assignment at Trey Corp is to update some of the legacy code.
The code to update is a Node.js express server that hosts web pages consisting of various utilities. I'm to find and fix any vulnerabilities I come across to improve overall security.
